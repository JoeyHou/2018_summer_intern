# 2018_summer_intern
During summer 2018, I interned in the technical department of Xinhua Net(Guangdong channel). Xinhua Net (xinhuanet.com) is the official website for Xinhua News Agency, the official news agency of Chinese government.In this position, what I mainly did was to create some "news products", mostly mobile website, that make news more readable and interesting for our readers.

For example, one of the project I finished is called "The change of Shekou", a mobile website consists of pictures of Shekou in past 40 years. Shekou is a district of Shenzhen, one of the biggest cities in China as well as in the world. However, it was a very tiny port back in 1980s. Those pictures shows how greatly that area has expanded and became a large, international city.

Another example is called "Summer Safety Tips". It is a series of tips for childrens and students to stay safe during summer, as their parents are very likely to be working during summer and leaving them alone at home. That might leads to lost of safety issues so their safety is worth considering.

In those mobile websites, I used the javascript framework "fullpage" the most. I also used some other famework like "swiper". I didn't have to much web-dev experience before this, only knowing basic knowledge about html, css, and js languages. However, during the three months, I improved a lot.
